# Microhoods
### A travel guide for every city block.

Every block has a story. We give you a bird’s-eye-view of that story, created and curated by our users. Microhoods is a communal map that tells you everything you need to know about your city. Use microhoods to instantly get advice from locals--anytime, anywhere. 

Do you ever feel like you’re missing out on what to do in the city? Have you ever spent half of your day just trying to figure out what neighborhood to go to for drinks? Scoping out neighborhoods before you get there is hard, if not impossible, and you don’t have the time to explore every block.

With microhoods, users tag and describe their city’s neighborhoods. We weave those tags together to form a patchwork of experiences and perceptions of those neighborhoods of the city, block by block. Search microhoods for the best area to find good Thai, the back alleys to avoid on a late night, and the out of the way locations that are worth the trek.

Our users email us every day about all the great ways they’re using microhoods. They tell us about all the places they discovered that they never would have explored if it wasn’t for microhoods. Businesses tell us how happy they are that we’re helping new customers discover their neighborhoods.

> “Microhoods makes it easy to get to know the city without spending all the time exploring places that aren’t worth seeing,” said Austen Talbot, creator of microhoods. “You can narrow down which neighborhoods to visit based on what you’re looking for and keep track of all the unique things each block has to offer. It’s great to get a quick overview of the character of a neighborhood before you’ve left your house, and given how big and diverse San Francisco is, microhoods has really helped me in finding the neighborhoods where I like to go out on a Saturday night or relax on a Sunday afternoon.”

Sign up for microhoods and start exploring the city. Search out all the neighborhoods you’ve never had the time to visit and figure out which ones are worth the trip. Add your take on your own block to help others figure out why it’s worth visiting your neighborhood.
